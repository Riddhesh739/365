🚀 APP-365 | Built by Riddhesh 
A Computer Science student who believes the best way to learn is by building in public.

**One minute a day. No edits. No filters. Just you.**

## What is 365?
365 is a minimalist app where users capture **one moment per day** for an entire year.
- One post per day
- Under 60 seconds
- Never editable

It becomes a Year-long timeline of real life.

# How it works
Each day, users post **one**:
* 📝 Sentence
* 📸 Photo
* 🎙️ 10-second voice note

Visibility options:
* Only me
* Close circle
* Anonymous public feed

Optional daily prompts gently encourage reflection.

No noise. No scrolling.
**Silence is the flex.**

# Tech Stack Used
* Next.js (App Router)
* TypeScript
* Supabase (Auth, DB, Storage)
* Tailwind CSS

# Why this project
This isn’t a demo app.
It includes auth, time-based locks, streak logic, media uploads, and privacy layers.
